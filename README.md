1. **Simulation:** Explore the physical simulation of Silicon Dangling Bonds to understand their behavior and properties.
2. **Logic Design:** Learn how to design logic gates using SiDBs.
3. **Analysis:** Analyze the designed gates and evaluate their performance.
4. **Circuit Design:** Build and test circuits based on SiDBs, considering the impact of defects.
